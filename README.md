## VueJS Task Manager
Version 0.0.1

Trello inspired task manager written in JavaScript using the VueJS framework.

### Still to do:
* Add local-storage instead of temporary save.
* Add delete task functionality.
* Add delete category functionality.
* Unfocus on category create.
* Clean up CSS.

#### Possible future features (being considered)
* Task input focus open, and close on unfocus.
* Implement NodeJS user authentication (PassportJS).
